###  LmdExplorer

**LmdExplorer** is an experimental user interface for exploring the
lmd-full midi dataset created by Colin Raffel. This dataset contains
more than 160,000 midi files collected from the web. The program
is similar to midiexplorer with a couple of exceptions. lmdExplorer
also links to two external json files, md5_to_paths.json and 
midicaps_huggingface_train.json that can be downloaded from
<https://sourceforge.net/projects/lmdexplorer/>. 

More details on how to run the program can be found on
<https://lmdexplorer.sourceforge.io>.
